# Spring pendulum

![](spring_pendulum.gif)

Here is an undamped spring pendulum with spring constant 20 N/m.  The faded, grey circle is represents the radius in which the pendulum is at equilibrium. Notice that it tends to stray on the inside of the grey circle, as gravity works with Hooke's Law to push the pendulum bob away from the origin on the inside.
