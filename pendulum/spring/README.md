# Spring pendulum

Here is an undamped spring pendulum with spring constant 20 N/m.  The faded, grey circle is represents the radius in which the pendulum is at equilibrium. Notice that it tends to stray away from the inside of the grey circle, as gravity works with Hooke's Law to push the pendulum bob away from the origin once past the grey circle.  It'd be nice to be able to animate a spring here, but this seems fairly complicated!

Once can derive the differential equations to solve here by considering Newton's Second Law in polar coordinates and taking into account the relevant forces involved for the polar and radial unit vectors, namely Hooke's Law and the gravitational force. I can derive this formally if anyone wishes.
