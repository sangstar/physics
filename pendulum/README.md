# Pendulum physics animations

This code is used to animate a damped, single pendulum. I used Jason VanderPlas's article [here](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/) to help me understand how to simulate this using objects, and how to animate the effects. The animation portion of this code was almost entirely ripped from his source code, as I'm quite unfamiliar with animations as it stands. I later intend on animating this with my own code. 

The damping constant and pivot length among other parameters can be changed freely.
