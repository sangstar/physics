## Wild Box

Just a little fun animation of mine. Particles of constantly varying size and color with random velocity vectors move around in a box. Some assumptions here:

1. The particles don't interact with eachother

2. Completely elastic collision to boundaries.

The animation is in the `animation_example` folder. I've enclosed it in here instead of just having it displayed here because I want to give an epilepsy warning before the user sees it -- the colors change constantly for each particle, which amounts to a lot of flashing and contrasting colors.
